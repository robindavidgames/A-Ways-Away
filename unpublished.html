                        <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p>Verdant Arizona is a 2-player competitive drafting and puzzle game. Players are owners of rival botanical gardens, colling cactus samples for their own institution. Unfortnately, budget cuts mean that they have to travel around the flower markets in the same car! Gameplay requires players to watch one another's boards and solve a tough scoring puzzle on each of their turns.</p>

                        <p>Features: Closed economy auction game. High player count with few components. 20-30 minutes. Push your luck. Tableau building. Lots of yelling!</p>
                        <p>Audience: Families and gamers.</p>
                        <p>Number of players: 3-6</p>
                        <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p>Deal With It is a fast auction game with a closed economy. Having such an economy makes it easier than many auction games - players don't have to wonder too much about how much things are worth.</p>
                        <p>In Deal With It, players buy and sell fruit cards, to amass high scoring collections of fruits OR to just get rich. Either approach can win you the game!</p>
                        <p>The order in which players buy fruit cards determines the value of those cards, so players must carefully time their actions. Running out of money at the wrong time can ruin your plans! On their turn, a player puts a card from their hand up for auction. If another player wins the auction, the original player is paid the winning bid. If the original player wins the auction, the pickles are removed from the game. Cards that are won at auction are placed in a player's tableau following very simple rules.</p>
                        <p>Once every card has been auctioned, the game is over. Fruits in tableaus are worth points depending on how they are positioned relative to other fruits. Subsequently, the same fruit can be worth different amounts to different players. Coins are also worth points, opening up another possible route to victory for shrewd fruit sellers.</p>
