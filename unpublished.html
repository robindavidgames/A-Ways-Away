                        <p>Features: Card drafting, civilisation building, simple rules. 30-45 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Number of players: 2-4</p>
                        <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p>In <em>Cúige</em>, players are leaders of ancient Irish clans who have been called to the Hill of Tara by the High King. He declares that Viking invaders are coming and the clans must work to develop their strength and wealth, while building intertribe unity with culture and happiness. The king has granted you three seasons in which to fortify your clans. Fail, and the invaders may well destroy Irish civilisation forever.</p>
                        <p><em>Cúige: Path to Tara</em> is a game for 2-4 players and takes place over three seasons. On a turn, players pick cards to join their clan, then split the available cards for the next player’s pick. At the end of each season, clans are judged based on their happiness, culture, strength, and wealth. After three seasons, the clans return to Tara to decide the winner.</p>

                        <p>Features: Real world locations, price setting mechanisms, high interaction, simple rules, simple components. 30-45 minutes. Language independent.</p>
                        <p>Number of players: 3-4</p>
                        <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p>Prepare to enter the cutthroat world of milk delivery! In the olden days (i.e., the 1990s), it was common to get milk delivered to your home each morning. Milk deliveries were run by dairy companies, who would have to bid for their routes. The better routes would earn more money with fewer deliveries and the very best would do this while already being close to another route.</p>
                        <p>In this game, 3-4 players are owners of dairy companies. They will start with a handful of cash and a selection of routes. On their turn, they offer two routes for sale at a price of their choosing, and give other players a chance to buy those routes. But not all neighbourhoods are equal, and even more importantly, each player will value them in vastly different ways. And what if you don’t really want the other players to buy your routes?!?</p>

                        <p>Features: Closed economy auction game. High player count with few components. 20-30 minutes. Push your luck. Tableau building. Lots of yelling!</p>
                        <p>Audience: Families and gamers.</p>
                        <p>Number of players: 3-6</p>
                        <h3>Details</h3>
                        <p><em>Deal With</em> It is a fast auction game with a closed economy. Having such an economy makes it easier than many auction games - players don't have to wonder too much about how much things are worth.</p>
                        <p>In Deal With It, players buy and sell fruit cards, to amass high scoring collections of fruits OR to just get rich. Either approach can win you the game!</p>
                        <p>The order in which players buy fruit cards determines the value of those cards, so players must carefully time their actions. Running out of money at the wrong time can ruin your plans! On their turn, a player puts a card from their hand up for auction. If another player wins the auction, the original player is paid the winning bid. If the original player wins the auction, the pickles are removed from the game. Cards that are won at auction are placed in a player's tableau following very simple rules.</p>
                        <p>Once every card has been auctioned, the game is over. Fruits in tableaus are worth points depending on how they are positioned relative to other fruits. Subsequently, the same fruit can be worth different amounts to different players. Coins are also worth points, opening up another possible route to victory for shrewd fruit sellers.</p>
