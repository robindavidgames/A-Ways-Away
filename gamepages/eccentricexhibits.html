                        <h1>Eccentric Exhibits</h1>
                        <p><em>Eccentric Exhibits</em> is a 2-player, 20-card trick-taking game. In this game, players are rival museum curators trying to arrange the most prestigious exhibitions of bizarre and unusual artifacts - unicorn hooves, kraken tentacles, books of pure evil, and alien skulls, to name a few.</p>
                        <p>Over four rounds, two players will play a series of tricks, trying to win artifacts for their museums and score prestige. The twist is that the highest scoring cards are not always the cards most likely to win a trick, so huge bonus points are available if you can deduce what cards your opponent is able to play and which tricks they are able to win.</p>
                        <p>With only 20 cards to keep track of, skills in deduction and risk management are paramount. <em>Eccentric Exhibits</em> is a tense, high-skill game for two players.</p>
                        <p>The game is free to download and play. Find it on itch.io.</p>
